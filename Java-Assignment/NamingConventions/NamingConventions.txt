NamingConventions is considered one of the best practice to achieve clean code.There are many ways to write a program for a computer to understand but it is also as imaportant to write a code so that fellow programmer or developer can understand this what makes one better developer.In Programming language following Name conventions are used for different components in the program:
Consider an Example of StringBuilder Class:
Naming Convention Rules for Class:
Class name should start with capital letter,if there is any word to be associated camel casing rule need to be followed i.e., making the starting letter of word capital


Example:

class stringbuilder{  //Incorrect Naming Convention
}
  
class StringBuilder{  //Correct Naming Convention
}
  
Naming Convention Rules for methods:
Method names should start with lower case letter if any word nedd to be associated camel casing rule need to followed:
 
Example:

public void Append(){  //Incorrect Naming Convention
}
 
public void append(){  //correct Naming Convention
}
  

public void tostring(){  //Incorrect Naming Convention
}

public void toString(){  //correct Naming Convention
}



Naming Convention Rules for variables:
variable names must be started with letter or underscore it is always better to write meaningful name
 
Example:
 
int 9var;   //Incorrect naming Convention
int var;    //Correct Naming Convention
